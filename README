1) Description of the scripts
-----------------------------

These are php scripts to import the users and groups from already existing
user and/or group files into DB2.

The sync_pwds script is for syncing the system passwords with the user table in
the database.

You have to change the settings in the config.php file for your environment.

Here is a table of the relation between the directives for the mod_auth_ibmdb2 module
and the settings in the config.php file:

config.php					module directive

$dbname = "auth";				AuthIBMDB2Database
$dbuser = "db2inst1";				AuthIBMDB2User
$dbpwd  = "db2inst1";				AuthIBMDB2Password

$usertable  = "users";				AuthIBMDB2UserTable
$grouptable = "groups";				AuthIBMDB2GroupTable

$namefield     = "username";			AuthIBMDB2NameField	
$passwordfield = "password";			AuthIBMDB2PasswordField		
$groupfield    = "groupname";			AuthIBMDB2GroupField		

As an example:

If the settings in the config.php are as above and you execute the
user_imp script following happens:

All users (except system users) are imported from the linux box into the 
table 'users' in the database 'auth'.
The table 'users' has 'username' as the columnname for the users and
'password' as the columnname for the passwords.
